# suicide_google_news_bangladesh

In this repository, I have provided the data collection procedure for Google News scraping for a particular topic of suicide in the geographical region of Bangladesh. Here I have also shown the data cleaning procedure and how the data has been used to create the wordcloud in python. I have also uploaded the wordcloud itself along with the raw data that I got from news scraping.

Please feel free to ask me questions. I have provided the interpretation of the results in the Medium post.

In case, you end up using the code and idea of this project for your own research or other work, I would appreciate an acknowledgement of this repository and my Medium article.
